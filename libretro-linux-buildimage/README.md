# Overview
This repo houses the Dockerfile that defines the docker image that builds libretro for linux x86_64. 

This project can be used to build linux binaries on your local machine for development/testing purposes. This image is also deployed in the cloud [here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/l3iggs/libretro-linux-buildimage/) for automated nightly builds of linux x86_64 binaries.

# Typical usage
1. [Install Docker](http://docs.docker.com/installation/)
1. Run the build bot:  
  `docker run l3iggs/libretro-linux-buildimage`  
   This command will fetch the build image, update libretro code and build the latest libretro and all cores
1. Extract the compressed binaries you just built:  
  `docker cp $(docker ps -l -q):/output/retroarch-linux.7z .`

__* .rpm .deb and arch package output in developement *__

# Extras
## Delta Builds
For a faster delta or incrimental build replace step 2 above with  
`docker run --env NOCLEAN=1 l3iggs/libretro-linux-buildimage`

## 
If you wish to replace any of the upstream git repositores with your own personal repositories during the build do the following  
`TODO: docker ... /root/.repo/local_manifest/local.xml ...`  
where `local.xml` is a xml file that describes your repositories that you'd like to use in place of the upstream ones formatted like this (for reference see the upstream default manifest .xml file [here](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-manifest/blob/master/default.xml):
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <remote fetch="https://github.com/l3iggs/" name="mygithub"/>
	<project name="snes9x" path="libretro-super/libretro-s9x" remote="mygithub" />
</manifest>
```
